## Problem(s) encountered
 When added more radiobutton to make more function will stop unexpectedly.
 

## Discussions and Summaries
First time used Java language to write program. There have some code and punctuation different with another programming language. In this program, when set frequency to higher, the tone output will be higher. In different type of wave also will generate different kind of sound.

## What I have learned in this assignment
* How to write program using Java language.
* Build program in GUI form.
* Generate sound in different wave
* Wav file format
* Output an Audible file
